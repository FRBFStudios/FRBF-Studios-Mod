# About
Since I already knew how to use Java, I thought to myself, might as well get into Minecraft Modding. So, I started a small project where I'm just messing around and implementing stuff suggested by friends.\
Everything that has been implemented so far is Hatsune Miku-themed because I have a friend obsessed with her :P

**Dependencies:**\
Fabric for Minecraft 1.21.1\
Fabric API
